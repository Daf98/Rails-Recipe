# Recipe app

> The Recipe app keeps track of recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them. This is the used [data model](./app/assets/images/recipe_erd_2_members.png).
